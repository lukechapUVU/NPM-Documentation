## Steps to complete the assignment

1. Create an index.md file on the main branch.
2. Follow the prompts below to create a markdown document inside the index.md file. For a guide on markdown, use the [GitHub Markdown Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#links).
3. Once your index.md file is complete, go to the repo settings on Github and then to the Pages tab.
4. To enable Github Pages, select a source branch. Select the main branch, leave the /root as the default and click save.
5. You site will publish automatially. It could take a few minutes to publish.
6. Leave the visibility **private**. *Changing this to public will result in a 0 for the assignment.*
